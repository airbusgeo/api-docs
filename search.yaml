  title: Airbus Defence and Space Geo - Search API
  description: |
    This document describes Airbus Defence and Space Geo Search API. The Search API can be used to query the products available for ordering.
    
    __IMPORTANT -__ You should follow the [Geo APIs recommendations](/api-docs/recommendations.html) when implementing clients.
    
    You can consult the [version log](/api-docs/search/CHANGELOG.html) for information about modification history.
    
    __STANDARD RULES -__ The following rules apply to attributes format when specifyed.
    
    Intervals for numerical values and dates are specified using the standard straights brackets.
    * [n1,n2] equal to n1 <= field <= n2
    * [n1,n2[ equals to n1 <= field < n2
    * ]n1,n2[ equals to n1 < field < n2
    * ]n1,n2] equal to n1 < field <= n2
    * [n1 equals to n1<= field
    * ]n1 equals to n1 < field
    * n1] equals to field <= n1
    * n1[ equals to field < n1
